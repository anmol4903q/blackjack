# 🃏 Simple Blackjack Game — Python Project 🎮

## About the Project

This is a simple terminal-based Blackjack game I created in Python as part of my learning journey. It was a really fun and surprisingly easy project once I got started — and it helped me understand how game logic, randomness, and user interaction all work together!

## How the Game Works

- You and the computer each get two cards.
- You get a chance to swap one of your cards.
- Then you reveal the totals — and see who wins!
- Aces are handled smartly (can be 11 or 1 depending on the total).
- The game continues until you decide to quit.

## My Learning Journey 🛤️

At first, this project felt like a big challenge. I had no clue what Blackjack even was! 🤯  
So, I visited a Blackjack website, played a few rounds, and slowly started understanding the rules, the card names, and how scoring works. 

Once that clicked, I started coding — and suddenly, it didn’t feel that hard anymore!  
Piece by piece, it all came together and turned into a full working game.  
Honestly, it was **so much fun** completing this — it boosted my confidence big time!

## Special Thanks 🙏

Big shoutout to **Angela Yu** and her **100 Days of Code: Python** course on Udemy.  
Every day, the course gives me new projects to work on, and I genuinely feel like I’m growing as a developer day by day. This Blackjack game is one of those awesome milestones! 🚀
